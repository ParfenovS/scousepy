    Notes
    -----
    The method for identifying noise channels is described in Riener+ 2019,
    and has been adapted from the method in https://github.com/mriener/gausspyplus
    credit for the method design goes to Manuel Riener.

    Most of the technical parts of the code below is lifted directly from
    https://github.com/mriener/gausspyplus/blob/master/gausspyplus/utils/noise_estimation.py
    JDH wrapped it up and tinkered a bit.

        Parameters
        ----------

        spectral_axis : array
            An array of values corresponding to the spectral axis (e.g. velocity)
        spectrum : numpy.ndarray
            Array of the data values of the spectrum
        p_limit : float
            Maximum probability for consecutive positive/negative channels being
            due to chance
        pad_channels : int
            Number of channels by which an interval (low, upp) gets extended on
            both sides, resulting in (low - pad_channels, upp + pad_channels).
            Used for masking of spectral features
        n_mad : float
            Multiple of the median absolute deviation. Used to identify spikes
            in the data which are not noise. All channels below nmad*MAD are
            considered "noise"
        remove_broad : boolean
            Determines method by which the noise channels are identified.
            Default=True. If True, broad components are removed using a simple
            Markov chain to estimate the probability that consecutive +ve or -ve
            channels are due to noise (assuming Gaussian noise). See
            Riener+ 2019 Appendix A for details. If False, a simple method of
            reflected noise is imposed.
